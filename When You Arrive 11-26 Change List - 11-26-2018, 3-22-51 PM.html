&quot;If your memory loss was caused by a malfunction in your individual cryo chamber, then yes. But if something deeper within the system is broken… it's possible they are all in the dark, as well.&quot; An open, gasping mouth flashes from Joshua's container. &quot;I suspect we shall find out soon.&quot;

A fist pushes through the gas in Yusuf's container, and then snaps back. He must be struggling with the constraints, you think. The gas starts to fade away, and full faces begin to emerge. Teenesee's eyes are open, darting around as the ceiling comes into view for her. They rest when they find you, and tighten.

Joana's mouth is wide open, throat vibrating. You hear nothing on the other side of the glass, but her screams are clear. Arms flailing. You see Sarah and Joshua's lips moving slowly. They must be talking with CINDI, trying to reason with her as you did. There's a panic in Joshua's eyes as he turns in his container, looking for the source of CINDI's voice asking for identification.

Sarah's eyes find you, and then turn away, as she continues to talk with the artificial intelligence. Yusuf's lips are still as he feels the sides of his container, pushing at it as much as the constraints allow, looking for a weakness. Teenesee's eyes still rest squarely on you without wavering. Joana's eyes <del>find</del><ins>lock onto</ins> you, floating above her. She stretches out a finger towards you, quickly pulled back to the container's base, redirecting her silent screams towards you instead of the sentient voice.

[[&quot;They don't remember.&quot;]]

The silence is broken by the sound of five glass panels lifting and sliding off the chambers. In an instant, there's <ins>//</ins>a cacophony of sounds<del>.</del><ins>// &lt;-- you've used this; maybe change here or link the uses.//</ins> Yells and grunts from the people struggling against their constraints, turning into surprise as their released. And Joana's voice rising above the others.

&quot;What the fuck is this? What the fu--&quot; She stops as she feels herself floating up from the container. Her confusion and anger is splintered by a moment of wonder at the sensation of weightlessness. Her shoulder-length curls dangling themselves in front of her face. Her eyes find you again, and the wonder vanishes.

&quot;Who the fuck are you, and what did you do to me?&quot; Her eyes are red. &quot;Why can't I remember shit?&quot;

[[&quot;I wish I could tell you.&quot;]]

You recognize it as a delta. There<del>'s</del><ins> are</ins> large boxes attached to the back.

&quot;They must be hazard suits of some kind,&quot; says Sarah, whose locker is close. &quot;For whatever is beyond the door.&quot;

&quot;Under normal circumstances I would take offense at being referred to as 'the robot,'&quot; says CINDI. &quot;However, considering the situation, I will excuse this lapse in judgment.

The rectangular shape of the projection feels odd in the circular space, and you find yourself at an angle from the intended perspective.

&quot;This is our Earth, on its deathbed,&quot; says a voice. The projection shows an orb, hanging in the midst of the stars. White clouds spiraling about oceans. Blue encompassing almost all, islands of green and brown. Most with billowing smoke spiraling into the atmosphere.

&quot;As you take your first steps onto this alien world,&quot; the voice continues, &quot;don't forget why we're doing this.&quot;

The image fades, and soon the projection shows a man, sitting behind a desk. The wall behind him has the text &quot;PROXIMA&quot; printed in large letters. The X styled the same as the one you've seen around the ship.

&quot;Welcome to Proxima Centauri. You brave souls. You lucky bastards.&quot; There's a grin that splits across his face.

&quot;This is the official mission briefing for Project Exodus. A reference point for what you already know. Something to... look back on, if things become less clear. As they often do... in the brush of this new frontier.&quot;

The projection slowly moves closer to the man, until his face takes up most of it. There's a weak stubble littering his chin and cheeks.

&quot;The nine of you are fulfilling the mission of this company since its inception: to bring humanity to the stars. Beyond the Sol system we call home.&quot; The smile falters. &quot;Most of you are scientists. All of you have the hearts of explorers. But I remind you: we are in a fight for the very survival of our race. I know your first instinct will be learn as much as you can. Don't get lost trying to understand this place. There will be time for that, later.

&quot;Your goal is simple: identify and retrieve strands of the bacteria //Proximus fomes//, whose origins we have traced here. This biological material is the fuel for the Exodus Drive that powers the //Prodromos//, that will power the Arks to evacuate Earth.

&quot;//Proximus fomes// was discovered under the ice of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Soon after, it was discovered this alien microbial life can create small bends in space-time. The Exodus Drive uses that to enable faster-than-light travel. It's easiest to describe via analogy. These &quot;bends&quot; can allow a ship to be spun fast enough that it can be &quot;skipped&quot; across space-time to its destination. Like a small rock on a pond.

&quot;Yours is the first ship to use this. The first, we hope, of many. But without those samples, these engines are worth nothing. Including the one on your ship now. The only way home is by finding that biofuel.

&quot;Determining the permanent habitability of the planet is a secondary objective. If you encounter intelligent life, avoid it at all costs. Refer to CINDI's 'First Contact' protocol if necessary.

&quot;Those samples are essential. They take precedent over all else, including your own lives.&quot;

The man presses a button and images appear above his desk. A long cylinder, a small pill-shaped device, and what looks like a syringe.

&quot;To accomplish this task, you've each been equipped with a set of tools. The first is your Microbial Collector.&quot; The syringe-looking device is highlighted. &quot;It is designed to ingest material from an environment -- liquid, rock, gaseous, what have you -- and detect if there is any biological material. If there is, it can connect to a Fuel Cell for storage.&quot; The cylinder is highlighted. The holographic images demonstrate this transfer of material.

&quot;These Fuel Cells not only contain your biosamples, but interface directly with the Exodus Engine. You'll notice there's a substance already inside these Fuel Cells. That's an activator, a substance that prepares this biological material for use in the engine.

&quot;The details aren't important. Leave that for the theoretical physicists. All you need to know is to find the bacteria we've tracked back to this planet, collect as much of it as you can, and come back.&quot;

The objects disappear. The man at the desk leans forward. &quot;I don't have to tell you how important it is that you accomplish this. That you come back. We have contingencies in place to ensure the best of humanity can survive until your return, whether that's on Earth or elsewhere in Sol. But I can imagine it'll be easy to get... caught up in the most profound discoveries of our civilization. I wish we had more time to let you relish in that.&quot;

He looks to off the camera to the right, and then back. &quot;But we don't. So, I'll just remind you: come back. Quick as you can. The Arks will be ready and waiting.&quot;

It seems like he's done, as he leans back, until there's a twinkle in his eye. &quot;Do try and have some fun while you're at it. Legends need stories to tell, after all.&quot;

His eyes got lost somewhere, the tip of his tongue massaging his lower lip. Until he snaps back.

&quot;Good luck out there, Captain Silva. This... all started with you. See it through.&quot; He gives a curt nod. &quot;This is Ezra Caval, on behalf of the Proxima Corporation, signing off.&quot;

The image cuts to the same logo that was printed on the back of the wall. &quot;PROXIMA,&quot; with a jingle, just before the video comes to an end and the projection disappears.

Lights begins to rise. Bouncing off the white walls. The X's marking the doors and the sleepers now given something to represent: the Proxima Corporation.

&quot;I hope that was illuminating,&quot; says CINDI. &quot;I am happy to answer whatever supplementary questions you may have.&quot;

You look around at the confused faces of these strangers... your crew.

&quot;Wh- what's Earth?&quot; says Yusuf. His voice quieter than before. It's the question you were all too afraid to ask. The question that reminds you just how much of yourselves has been lost.

The moment of silence between question and response feels eternal.

&quot;Earth is the fourth planet from the Sun in the Sol system, and the birthplace of humanity. Once a paradise of biodiversity, it is now on the brink of inhabitability.&quot;

&quot;So we're running away,&quot; says Sarah. &quot;From a planet that's dying.&quot;

&quot;You are the first explorers to journey beyond the Sol system, the first to begin the next chapter of humanity's interstellar journey!&quot; says CINDI. &quot;But yes, your planet is also dying.&quot;
